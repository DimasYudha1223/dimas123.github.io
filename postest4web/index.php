        <p>Regarding the origin of the name Samarinda, the oral tradition of the people of Samarinda states that the origin of the name Samalow is motivated by the position of the Mahakam River being as low as the mainland coast of the city that fortifies it. In the past, whenever the river was high, the outskirts of the city were always submerged. Furthermore, the edge of the Mahakam has been backfilled / stockpiled many times until now it has increased by 2 meters from its original height.

          Oemar Dachlan revealed that the origin of the word "sama randah" from the Banjar language is because the land surface remains low, does not move, not the surface of a river whose water rises and falls. This is because if the benchmark is a river, then the term is "equally high", not "equally low". The term "sama-randah" was originally given as the name of a location located on the edge of the Mahakam river. Over time the name developed into a melodic pronunciation: “Samarinda”.</p>
